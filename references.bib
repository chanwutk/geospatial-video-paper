abstract = {Many recent video applications---including traffic monitoring, drone analytics, autonomous driving, and virtual reality---require piecing together, combining, and operating over many related video streams. Despite the massive data volumes involved and the need to jointly reason (both spatially and temporally) about these videos, current techniques to store and manipulate such data are often limited to file systems and simple video processing frameworks that reason about a single video in isolation.We present Apperception, a new type of database management system optimized for geospatial video applications. Apperception comes with an easy to use data model to reason about multiple geospatial video data streams, and a programming interface for developers to collectively reason about the entities observed in those videos. Our demo will let users write queries over video using Apperception and retrieve (in real-time) both metadata and rendered video data. Users can also compare results and observe speedups achieved by using Apperception.},

In this article, we present MobilityDB, a moving object database that extends the type system of PostgreSQL and PostGIS with abstract data types for representing moving object data. The types are fully integrated into the platform to reuse its powerful data management features. Furthermore, MobilityDB builds on existing operations, indexing, aggregation, and optimization framework. This is all made accessible via the SQL query interface.},
