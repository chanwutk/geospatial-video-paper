\section{User Interface}
\ck{to focus: \\
- how we map the programming language to the user interface. For example, how do we present our data model visually in the graphical user tool. \\
- how do the queries that we can construct in the graphical user tool reflect the queries that we can construct with our query language. \\
- We do not have to try to cover all the cases that the query language can produce, but we should try to capture the one that are important.
For example, how to query by frames, how to query by instances, how to represent the lambda function, how to represent the custom function. \\
- It might be a good idea to create block-based programming language that mirror our query language (would this be easier than trying to design a new UI from ground up???)
