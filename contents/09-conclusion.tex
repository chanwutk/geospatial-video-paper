\section{Conclusion}

In this project, we explored prior attempts on geospatial-video data analysis tools.
We investigated their strengths and weaknesses.
We interviewed data journalists and programmers working on geospatial-video data analysis tasks.
Compiling the insights from both prior works and interviews, we designed a geospatial-video data analysis programming tool.
The tool presents a data model and a query language that add missing functionalities from prior works and are necessary to the tasks of our interviewee.
We also designed our tool to be extensible.
Users can add their own custom functions that are necessary for their data exploration tasks.
Finally, we designed a Graphical User Interface tool that allows users to do the same tasks as the programming tool with out programming experience.
