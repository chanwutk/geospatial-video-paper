For our prototype, we use the nuScenes dataset~\cite{ceasar:nuscenes}, a collection of camera, lidar, and radar images to facilitate autonomous driving research. Data is collected from 15 hours of driving data in Boston and Singapore, and key frames are sampled at a rate of 2Hz for labeling by human annotators, resulting in a rich collection of information suitable for various downstream needs in autonomous driving research. The structure of the decomposition of video frames into data and annotation structure was a good representative of geospatial settings for our language design.
