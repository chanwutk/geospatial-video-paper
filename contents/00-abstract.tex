% Geospatial-Video data analysis tasks require storing and retrieving videos to answer questions about their data.
Geospatial-video databases help data scientists store their video data efficiently,
but many of them do not provide intuitive query languages for the data scientists to retrieve the data back.
Databases with intuitive query languages provide data abstractions that hide their internal data representations.
These data abstractions limit the number of operations that data scientists can perform on their data. In this paper, we address the failure for existing languages to easily enable queries to video frames, as identified through need-finding interviews with users of geospatial-video query languages. 
%As a response, we propose improvements to the expressiveness of the existing geospatial-video data analysis tool.
We focus on its data abstraction and query language design.
Our new data abstraction additionally includes a video frame data-type.
Our new query language provides operations for users to reason about video frames in their data.
